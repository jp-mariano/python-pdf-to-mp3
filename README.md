# PDF to MP3 File Converter in Python
The goal of this project is to be able to code a file converter in Python.

## File Organization
Inside the `src` directory, create your own folders where you will store the `pdf` and `mp3` files.

## Google Text-to-Speech
This is the module used in converting text to an `mp3` file. An internet connection is needed in order for this module to work because it uses Google Translate's Text-to-Speech API.

## PyPDF2
This module is used to parse the text contents of the `pdf` file that we want to convert to speech.
